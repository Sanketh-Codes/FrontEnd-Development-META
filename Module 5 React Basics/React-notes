React is widely used as it is the js library and also easy to understand
---> In react the small components combine to create a UI website.
---> Lets understand the exports and imports
    For example you are using the function and want that to be used in part of the application so we make that file as module
    First we need to export that module so that we can import where ever we want
    Ways of exporting the module
    1)default export(using this we can have only one per module)
    example -> default export function addTwo(a,b){
        console.log(a+b);
    }
    or 
    function addTwo(a,b){
        console.log(a+b);
    }
     export default addTwo;
    2)named export(can have many)
    example -> export function addTwo(a,b){
        console.log(a+b);
    }
    or
     function addTwo(a,b){
        console.log(a+b);
    }
    export {addTwo};
    ===> Now lets see imports
    import is used wherever we want to use the exported module
    If we are exporting using the default export then
        import addTwo from "module location"
    If we are importijng using export then
        import {addTwo} from "module location"
    
**NOTE** ---> The default exort is used when the file name is same as function name and the named export is used when the file name is different from the file names
---> To craete the react app just run the following command
    npm init react-app appname
To start the react app just run npm start
