1)CSS -- Cascading Style sheets is used to say the browser how to render the content written in the HTML

2)In order to use the CSS we can do that in 3 ways
    a)Inline CSS --- using the style attribute in the element opening tag This is generally used to style the single element.
    b)interior Css -- using the <style></style> in the Head tag of the HTML. This is generally used to style the single page.
    c)Exterior CSS -- using the <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> in the Head tag of the HTML. This is generally used is there are many html pages and changing in the style.css file wull change the styling in all pages.
    here "style.css" is the file name of the css file.
    **NOTE** ===> Always the css files have the .css extension

3)The structure how we mention the styling for particular section is called css rule. and the syntax is
    example  - h1 {
                //here we need to write the key value pairs ending with semi-colon
                //these key value pairs called as property-value pairs  
            }
            **NOTE** ==> Here h1 is called the selector and the combination of all the property-value pairs is called as declaration block.
            ==> selector9in this case h1) tells the browser which element to target for the style.

4)There are many kinds of selectors.
    a)Element selector ---> syntax is h1{}
    b)ID selector      ---> syntax is #h1{} ---> In the entire html code the id will beunique and by this only particular element with that id will be styled.
    c)class selector ---> .h1{} ---> can assign same class name to different html elements

5)Descendents selecrors ---> This will be useful if the element which we want to style is inside other element.
    a) If we want to select a particular for suppose h1 which is present inside other element see example
        ex - <div id="demo">
                <h1>this is iside demo</h1>
                <div>
                    <h1>this is outside demo</h1>
                </div>
            </div>
             <h1>this is completely outside div element selected.
             
        Here if in style we mention #demo h1{} then first the element with the id="demo" will be selected and inside that element the style will be applied to all h1 tags present. here line no 23 and 25 will be styled
            -----> similarly can go to any depth for example if we want to style only line 25 then go to that div from the top syntax --- #demo div h1{}

    b) If we want to style only the immediate child of the selected element then we need to use the child selector in css that is #demo > h1{}
        --> Here from the previous example if we use #demo > h1{} then only the immediate h1 element will be selected.
        that is only the line 23 will be styled.

6):hover
    syntax - a:hover{} ---> used to style the elements when we hover the mouse. mostly used for links

7)The content will be surrounded by the padding and padding wil be surrounded by the border and border wil be surrounded the margin 
    remember as content < padding < border < marin
    BOX model this is used o organise the content in the webpage
    margin specifies the distant between the two elements

8)  block ---> css - display:block means the element will start in the new line and occupies the entire screen width
        ---> The block elements will insert one empty line up and down in the web browser.
    inline ---> css - display:inline means the element will not start in the new line
        ---> The inline element will occupy just the size of the content and not start in the new line.
        **NOTE** ===> By default there are some block and inline elements
            <div>,<h1> to <h6> all are block elements
            <span>,<em>,<i> these are inline elements

9) margin propert in css is used to give the distance between the elements
