difference btw <b> and <strong> ?
    <b>(bold Tag)----> is used when we need to draw the user attention
    <strong>Tag -----> is used when we want to mention something is so important in the text.
NOTE====> On screen there will be no difference in appearance only difference is the context of using.

1) HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language)----> This is the standard language used by the web browser to structure the content.
2) HTML consists of elements
    element is made of start Tag + content + end Tag    
    example - <p>WEb development is love</p>
    ==> here <p> is the sart Tag, "Web development is love" is content and </p> is the closing Tag
    **NOTE**----> some elements doesnt have the content and closing tag example- <br>(Line break) called as empty elements
    **NOTE**----> We cannot see the tags in the browser but browser uses the tags and understand how the content between those tags should be displayed 

    HTML structure
    1)<DOCTTPE !HTML> ---> This specifies the web browser that the document belongs to HTML 5
    2)<HTML></HTML> -----> This is the root element of the HTML (any tags should be inside this tag)
    3)<HEAD></HEAD> -----> This is the tag where we include the meta data 
    4)<TITLE></TITLE> ---> This is used to give the title to the page that is seen at the top tab(should be written inside the HEAD tag)
    5)<BODY></BODY> -----> Any content that is displayed on screen should be mentioned inside this tag.

3)Attributes are you to specify additional information about the elemens.
    ---> Always included in the starting tag of the element
    ---> title attribute is used to specify the text when we hover the mouse
        example-- <p title="This is title">Welcome to web dev</p> here when we hover mouse on "welcome to web dev"
                   the title is visible

4)In HTML even if we give spaces and write content in differen lines the browser omits them
    example-- <p>Hi this is web development
                 first we will learn HTML
                 Then CSS
              </p> 
                           
                The above code displays on a single line as Hi this is web development first we will learn HTML Then CSS

   **NOTE**---> In order to display the content as we write with spaces and line gaps use <pre></pre> tag

5) Some Tags which I rarely used
    a)<mark></mark> ---> The tet written in btw will be highlighted as yellow color (remember as just we do it in mail)
    b)<del></del> -----> The text written in btw will be striked off (remember as seen in VScode for dev prj)
    c)<sub></sub> -----> The text written in btw will be written some what down (remember as H2O)
    d)<sup></sup> -----> The text written in btw will be written some what up (remember as 2 square 2)
    e)<ins></ins> -----> The text written in btw will be written and underlined known as underlined
    f)<blockquote></blockquote>---> The text written specifies that text belongs to other source. Generally browser indent thos text.
    g)<q></q> ---> The browser adds the quotationmarks for the text.
    h)<abbr></abbr> ---> denotes that the text is shortform. Generally browser adds the dash made of dots to text
    i)<address></address> --> The browser adds one line at top and bottom and alsothe tests render in the italic format
                            -> Generally used to mention address like email, house address, phone number
    j)<cite></cite> ---> used to say the title of creative work. Browser renders he text as the italic.
    k)<bdo></bdo> ---> used to render the text from left to right and attribute will be dir="rtl".

6) Links attribute target has 4 values ("_self","_blank","_parent","_top") explaination is given in the hands-on file and image
