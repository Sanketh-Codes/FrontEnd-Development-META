1.Difference between static and Dynamic content?
    ---> Static content means the content will not depend on any particular condition and always generate the same result.
    ---> Static content is generated by the web browser. Ones the user clicks all the files present in the web browser will be displayed.
    ---> Dynamic content on the other hand will depend on the user choice and the conten will be varied based on the user input.
    ---> Dynamic content flow ===> one the user performs the action in the browser the request will be sent to the web browser and the web browser
                        inturn communicate with the application server(known as Back end). In this Application server all the application logic will    
                        be present and also the interaction with the Database happen here. This is a complex process and takes larger time to provide content.
2.Caching ---> This is the mechanism used by the web server (to load dynamic content)
            ---> When the user perform action the request will be sent to the web browser and then web browser will contact application server for dynamic content.
            the application server sends the content to the web browser.
            ---> The web browser will store the content from the application server in the cache and so when the user makes the same action again directky web browserr
                will return the required dynamic content. By this the performance will increase.
            **NOTE** ==> The cache will always be updated based on the actions performed

3. React is the javascript library.
    **Importtance of React**
    a) React has many inbuilt components which are ready to use in our applications. example - video player component, map component.
    b) We can attain the functionality with minimal code by just using the ready made components and combining them in our application.
    c) As react is the component based (component - a piece of code) we can always test and develop the isolated components so easily.
    d) As react is component based we can easily re use the component where we need in the application.

    **NOTE** ==> using react we can develop both web apps and also mobile appliacations(react native)
4.Why is the react best to build the UI interface is because of the performance time.
    This performance time is low because react uses the virtual DOM(document object model) unlike the browser DOM which is used by many other frameworks.
    Virtual DOM--> This is the DOM created by the react in the memory.
    But why using the virtual DOM the web app is faster?
        --> In the traditional browser DOM if the changes in the components code then the entire DOM will be rendered again
        --> But in the virtual DOM only the changed component code is changed in the browser DOM instead of entire DOM rendering. This is called "reconcilliation".
        Steps
            a) First the virtual DOM compares the components code with the browser DOM if there is any changes then the virtual DOM will update 
                that particular component code in the browser DOM.
            b) Virtual DOM always compares to the previous version of virtual DOM and the changed part is updated in the brwser DOM to render that particular part.
        
        **NOTE** ==> Browser DOM needs o be updated because the browser content which we see on the screen is the rendering from the browser DOM only.

5.But even with the virtual DOM if there are changes in almost all the components then the performance can still decrease thats why "React Fiber Architecture" 
    came into picture. With this the virtual DOM will update the browser DOM periodically.
        periodically? --> That means when we open the browser we will be able to see the certain part of the application on the screen witout scrolling
            so the virtual DOM will update only the browser DOM for only the components which are visible on the screen.
