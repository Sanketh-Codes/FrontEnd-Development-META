1.Bootstrap ---> This is the css and js library which is used to build the responsive web pages.
2.Responsive designs --> This is the combination of three techniques
                        a) Flexible Grids ---> consists of columns,glutter(the space between the columns) and margins(the space between the content and the left and right ends of screen)
                                          ---> Flexible grids does not use the screen pixel but use the percentage to adjust the content to any screen resolution
                        b) Fluid images ---> These are generally used with the <img> using this the images will be automatically set the width=100% and fits when the div container containing resizes (if the container becomes wider than the image then the image will not grow wider and will not loose pixels)
                        c) Media queries ---> this means css will conditionally apply the styles.

3.With the combination of the above three , responsive design is created which can adjust to any screen resolution. this is called responsive grid.
4.In bootstrap the screen pixels are called breakpoints.
5.Responsive grid has 3 types 
        a) Fixed Grid ---> has the fixed width content coloumns and flexible margins will occupy remaining space on screen.
        b) Fluid Grid ---> Has the fluid content columns that is the columns can grow or shrink with the available screen space.
