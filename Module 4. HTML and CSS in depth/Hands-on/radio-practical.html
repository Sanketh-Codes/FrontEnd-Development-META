            <!--
                fieldset is used to specify that there are many radio buttons and helps to map the correct radio butons to correct fieldset
                it is importatnt to note that the id attribute value of fieldset should match with the input name attribute value
                as seen below gender is being matched
            -->
            <!--
                for the mobile devices it becomes extremely tough to click the small circle so to improve the user experience
                we can make in such a way that the entire label itself act as a radio
                <label><input type="radio"  value="male" name="gender"> Male</label>
                 <label><input type="radio"  value="female" name="gender"> Female</label>
            -->
            <!--
                the checked attribute is generally used when we want that particular radio button is selected by default when form loads
            -->
