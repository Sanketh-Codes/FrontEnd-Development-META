---> CSS (Cascading Style sheet) used to design the web page (viewport means the website whuch we see).
---> previously we used the container class but CSS provides flexbox and grid which are responsive design options unlike container.
---> different bewtween flrxbox and grid?
    both are responsive but the difference is flexbox is 1-dimension i.e, the space gros or shrinks in either horizontal or vertical where as grid is 2-Dimensional.
    **NOTE** ---> lets see the flexbox-implementaion in flexboxPractical.html
---> uses of flexboxes
    a)used for the inline search box
    b)used for the navigation bar
    c)used for image gallery

-----------CSS selectors-------------------
1)We already know there are element selectors(p,h1,etc) , class selectors and id selectors
2)Apart from those there are several other selectors
    a)Attribute selectors
        example --> a[class]{
            //this selects and applies css for all the anchor tags which have the class
        }
        and 
        a[href*="meta"]{
            //this applies css to all the anchor tags which has the meta name in the href value attribute
        }
    b)n-th of child or n-th of type selector
        example --> li:nth-child(2){
            //this selects the nd child of the parent here in this case parent is UL or OL 
        }
        or
        li:nth-of-type(2){
             //this selects the nd child of the parent here in this case parent is UL or OL
        }
3)Star selector
    example --> *{
        //this selects all the elements of that particular HTML page
    }
4)Group selector
    if we want apply same css to both elements we can group them like
    p,h1{
        //both p and h1 elements are selected and styles are applied
    }

Note---> If the different styles are given to the same element by mistake then css engine follws some order and weight them and finally produces the styles
    order of the styles are
        a)inline ---> highest priority
        b)id
        c)classes and pseudo classes
        d)elements,pseudo elements
