---> CSS (Cascading Style sheet) used to design the web page (viewport means the website whuch we see).
---> previously we used the container class but CSS provides flexbox and grid which are responsive design options unlike container.
---> different bewtween flrxbox and grid?
    both are responsive but the difference is flexbox is 1-dimension i.e, the space gros or shrinks in either horizontal or vertical where as grid is 2-Dimensional.
    **NOTE** ---> lets see the flexbox-implementaion in flexboxPractical.html
---> uses of flexboxes
    a)used for the inline search box
    b)used for the navigation bar
    c)used for image gallery
