---> Generally when we share the link through the whatsaap chat we see that the along with the link some text and images    
     will also be shown as the preview and this is acheived using the meta tag only and is calles as "Open Graph Protocol"
---> This is also defined in the Head tag using the following syntax        
    <meta property="og:name" content="name">
    here always the property should begin with the og: and name can be like title, image, url, type(image, video,book),description.

This open graph protocol helps the user to know about the website even before visiting the link by seeing the preview and thus increases 
    the user experience.
