1)HTML--> Hyper Text Markup Language
    Hyper Text because we link page to other page
    Markup because we use tags to dislay content

        10)<col> --> column in a table

**NOTE** ===> The main use of semantics is tags is the accessability(for example disabled or any other) and search engine optimization.

------------------META DATA--------------------------------------------------------
1) Meta Data is defined as the data about the web page
2) Meta Data is important because this tells helps in the search engine optimization(SEO)
3) Meta Data is generally included in the head tag and the syntax is 
    <meta name="" content="">
    name attribute include the author, descripton, keywords(generally some search engines ignore and mark as spam), 
        robots and viewport(search engines scale according to device like mobile ipad and monitor)
    content attribute takes the value of the name 
        author---> james
        descripton ---> This page is about the famous book
        keywords ---> cricket, sports
        robots ---> index(intimates the search engine to analyze the page),follow(intimates the search engine to follow the liks of other page)
                    noindex(not analyze the page), nofollow(dont follow links to other pages)
        viewport ---> width =device-width, initial-scale=1.0(scales and gets the best user experience based on the screen)

4)Basic meta tags (meta tags For SEO) 
        <meta name="description"/> provides a brief description of the web page 
        
        <meta name=”title”/> specifies the title of the web page 
        
        <meta name="author" content="name"> specifies the author of the web page  
        
        <meta name="language" content="english"> specifies the language of the web page 
        
        
        
        <meta name="robots" content="index,follow" /> tells search engines how to crawl or index a certain page 
        
        <meta name="google"/> tells Google not to show the sitelinks search box for your page when showing search results 
        
        <meta name="googlebot" content=”notranslate” /> tells Google you don’t want to provide an automatic translation for your page if the user uses a different language  
        
        <meta name="revised" content="Sunday, July 18th, 2010, 5:15 pm" /> specifies the last modified date and time on which you have made certain changes 
        
        <meta name="rating" content="safe for kids"> specifies the expected audience for your page 
        
        <meta name="copyright" content="Copyright 2022"> specifies a Copyright 
5)<meta http-equiv="..."/> tags
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html"> specifies the format of the document returned by the server 

        <meta http-equiv="default-style"/>  specifies the format of the styling document 

        <meta http-equiv="refresh"/> specifies the duration of the page before it’s considered stale 

        <meta http-equiv=”Content-language”/> specifies the language of the page 

        <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache"> instructs the browser how to cache your page
6)Responsive design/mobile meta tags 
        <meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=yes"/> indicates that telephone numbers should appear as hypertext links that can be clicked to make a phone call 

        <meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="true"/> specifies that the page can be properly visualized on mobile devices 

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/> specifies the area of the window in which web content can be seen


---> Generally when we share the link through the whatsaap chat we see that the along with the link some text and images    
     will also be shown as the preview and this is acheived using the meta tag only and is calles as "Open Graph Protocol"
---> This is also defined in the Head tag using the following syntax        
    <meta property="og:name" content="name">
    here always the property should begin with the og: and name can be like title, image, url, type(image, video,book),description.

This open graph protocol helps the user to know about the website even before visiting the link by seeing the preview and thus increases 
    the user experience.    

--------------FORMS---------------------
forms validation can be done in ways
1)client side validation ---> allows basic functionalities using the type of the input and validating against the data entered.
2)server side validation ----> allows more complex checking and also can check the data matching the database values and business requirements

-------common input fields--------------------
1)button
    syntax --> <input type="button" id name value onclick="">
    syntax --> <button id name value onClick></button>
    note--> the difference btw both is with <button></button> we can place text or images as button.

2)checkbox
    syntax --> <input type="checkbox">
    note --> one or more values casn be selected

3)Radio
    syntax --> <input type="radio">
    note --> unlike checkbox we can only select one
4)submit
    generally used to submit all html form values to form handler generally a server and the for, handler is written in the action 
    syntax --> <form action="" method="get or post">
        -----------------
        <input type="submit">
    </form> 
5)Text
    syntax -- <input type="text">
6)password
    syntax --> <input type="password">
7)date  
    syntax --> <input type="date">  ===> only date i.e month and year and no time
8)Datetime local
    syntax --> <input type="datetime-local"> ===? included both date time
9)email
    syntax --> <input type="email">
10)file
    syntax --> <input type="file">
    gives the control to upload the files to upload from computer
     ==> for particular types of files to accept provide the accept attribute
     ==> for multiple file provide multiple attribute
11) Hidden
    syntax --> <input type="hidden" id="custId" name="custId" value="3487">
    not displayed on the Ui but value submitted to server
12)image
    syntax --> <input type="image" src="">
    used to display image as a submit button and src should hold the image location
13)number and range
    syntax -> <input type="number" min="" max="">
14)telephone
    syntax --> <input type="tel">
15)reset
    syntax --> <input type="reset">
    resets the entire form to default values
16)search   
    defines a text field to enter a search query
    <input type="search">
17)url(performs automatic validation before sending data to server)
    syntax --> <input type="url">


*****note***** ====> The id attribute is used in theinput field because the same id attribute value will be used to set the label.
    example--> <label for="first_name">First name</label><br>
                <input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name">
    and the name attribute is used because in the server side ones the form is submitted we can access the value using the name attribute value only

Why client side validation?
    client side validation increases the accessability and improve user experience
    And also minimize the unnecesassary http requests to the server i.e, minimizing the server resources

NOTE---> see the radio-practical.html to understand how radio buttons works

IMPORTANT----> How to add a datalist to the form
    step 1 -> create a input field and add the attributes id and name same like the other input types
        <input id="booking_location" name="booking_location">
    step 2 -> Then add another attribute named lists
        <input id="booking_location" name="booking_location" lists="locations">
    step 3 -> Then add the data lists and id attribute and the value of this id attribute should match with the value of the lists attribute in input field
        <datalist id="locations">
            <option value="silicon valley"></option>
            <option value="Colorado Boulder"></option>
        </datalist>
    
        final code with the label
        -----------------------------------------
        <label for="booking_location">Select location</label>
        <input id="booking_location" name="booking_location" lists="locations">
        <datalist id="locations">
            <option value="Silicon Valley"></option>
            <option value="Colorado Boulder"></option>
        </datalist>
    
The use of the datalist is when we have 1000s of values in the list its very hard to seearch for required value manually 
so with datalist we can start tyoing the required value and then select from the lists(minimized) 

-----Difference between get and post methods of form submitting----------
1)Get method ---> extremely vulnerable to threats and not secure because    
        the form data we enter apends to the URl 
        other drawback --> URL length becomes too large and might possible that the server cant get entire data because
                           some we browsers and servers are confined to certain URL length
2)Post method --> recommended and secure but third parties can still access the form data who is listening the http requests
        here the form data is sent as the body to the server
    
        To secure further we need to use the HTTPS which only receiver and sender has the access to the data.
    
The form fields looks different in different browsers and that makes the visibility inconsistency amongst the users
        To tackle that problem we can use the CSS styling to style the input fields or make use of libraries like 
            bootstrap, tailwind css and foundation

---> video tag
        <video height="" width="" controls loop> <!--loop is used to continuously run the video from start after completed entire-->
            <source src="" type="">
        </video>
---> audio tag
        <audio controls loop>
            <source src="" type="">
        </audio>

-----------------iframes-----------------------
These are used if you want to embed other external website content onto your website
        <iframe src=""></iframe>
    It is imporatant to note that there are many security vulnerabilities and can be solved using the allows attribute
        <iframe src="" allow="camera 'none';microphone 'none'"></iframe> <!--This will not allow the camera and microphone-->
    There is another attribute called sandbox which restricts the most important vulnerability
    <iframe src="" sandbox=""></iframe> <!--This will not allow any feaures-->
